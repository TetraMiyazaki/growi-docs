### Search options

When searching, options can be specified with the following notation. Options can be used together.

| Options | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| Search by multiple keywords | If multiple words with space in between are entered, the page name or body will be searched for pages that include all of them. <br /> For example, `word1 word2` will search for pages that contain both `word1` and `word2` in the page name or body. |
| Search for pages that include the specified text in the body | If text is entered with double quotes, the page that contains that text in the page body will be searched. <br /> For example, `"This is GROWI"` will search for pages that contain `This is GROWI` in the body text. |
| Exclusion by keyword | If a keyword is specified after a half-width hyphen `-`, the page that contains the keyword in the page name or body is excluded. <br /> For example, `-keyword` excludes pages that contain `keyword` in the page name or body. |
| Search by the first match of the page name | If a page name is specified after `prefix:`, pages starting with that page name is searched. <br /> For example, `prefix:/user/` finds pages whose page names start with `/user/`. |
| Exclusion by the first match of the page name | Specifying a page name after `-prefix:` excludes pages starting with that page name. <br /> For example, `-prefix:/user/` excludes pages whose page names start with `/user/`. |
| Search by tag | If a tag is specified after `tag:`, the page containing that tag will be searched. <br /> For example, `tag:wiki` will search for pages that contain the tag `wiki`. |
| Exclusion by tag | Specifying a tag after `-tag:` excludes pages that contain that tag. For example, `-tag:wiki` excludes pages that contain the tag `wiki`. |
